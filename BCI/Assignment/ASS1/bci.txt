3. What is resting membrane potential? Describe the sequence how resting potential
gives rise to an action potential. [5 marks]

The resting membrane potential (RMP) is the electrical potential difference across the cell membrane of a neuron or muscle 
cell when the cell is not actively firing or contracting. This potential is maintained by the selective permeability of 
the cell membrane to ions, with positively charged ions such as sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) being actively pumped out 
of the cell and negatively charged ions such as chloride (Cl-) and negatively charged proteins being allowed to remain inside 
the cell. The RMP is typically around -70 millivolts (mV) in neurons and -90 mV in muscle cells.

Resting membrane potential is the electrical potential difference across the cell membrane of a resting cell. 
It is the difference in electrical charge between the inside and outside of the cell. 



The resting potential of a neuron is the electrical charge across the cell membrane when the neuron is not actively firing an action potential. 
This charge is maintained by the balance of ions on either side of the membrane, with a higher concentration of negatively charged ions inside 
the cell and a higher concentration of positively charged ions outside the cell.

When a stimulus, such as a chemical signal from another neuron, causes the membrane to become more permeable to positively charged ions, 
the balance is disrupted and the inside of the cell becomes more positively charged. This is known as depolarization.

If the depolarization reaches a threshold level, the membrane potential becomes positive enough that voltage-gated ion channels open, 
allowing for a rapid influx of positively charged ions, primarily sodium (Na+), into the cell. This is known as the rising phase of the action potential.

As positive ions flood into the cell, the membrane potential rapidly becomes more positive, reaching its peak, known as the action potential. 
This is followed by a repolarization phase, where the membrane potential becomes more negative as positively charged ions are pumped out of 
the cell and negatively charged ions, primarily potassium (K+), enter the cell.

Once the membrane potential returns to the resting state, the neuron is ready to fire another action potential in response to a new stimulus.

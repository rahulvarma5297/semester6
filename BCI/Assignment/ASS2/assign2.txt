In addition, SMR-based BCIs have shown promise in improving the quality of life for individuals with motor impairments. These BCIs have been used to control a range of devices, including prosthetic limbs, wheelchairs, and communication devices. Research studies have shown that SMR-based BCIs can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of device control for individuals with motor impairments.
There are also potential applications the field of sports performance. SMR neurofeedback training has been studied as a means of improving athletic performance, particularly in sports that require precise motor control and timing. For example, studies have shown that SMR neurofeedback training can improve the accuracy and speed of golf swings and archery shots.
